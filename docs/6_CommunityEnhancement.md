# Community enhancement proposal

While this implementation of Oshiya functions in a rudimentary sense, the architecture is sluggish and prone to some functional flaws, hence optimizations are required..

This document proposes an incentive programme to be submitted for consideration by the Panther Foundation.

## Outcome of Community Enhancement

The outcome of this community driven initiative should be an effective Oshiya software architecture, which appropriately handles errors whilst providing an optimized revenue stream to zMiners while supporting continuous function. Furthermore, an intuitive UI should be produced for both the Oshiya web client and for monitoring of statistics, both from individual and internal (together global) points of view.

User interactions should be kept to a minimum to accommodate a hands-off approach to running Oshiya — allowing non-technical zMiners to participate and supporting future versions of the Protocol to allow users to self-process their own UTXOs and write them on-chain from within the dApp. Furthermore, the UI should be inviting and statistics should be clean and clear, to provide a professional experience to those zMiners that contribute to and benefit from the network.

## Proposed Incentive Scheme

This optimization will be run for a share of a $ZKP worth **$15,000USDT** in the reward pool. These rewards will be split according to the complexity of the proposal completed, seen assigned aside each Enhancement Proposal.

Understanding that there may be a variety of submissions, the protocol will consider awarding unsuccessful but impressive submissions with CREDITS.

Complexity Approximations

**LOW** Less time consuming and/or low complexity
**MEDIUM** Takes moderate time and effort
**HIGH** Significant time investment and/or complex task

**BONUS** Scope is open ended and features multiple inter dependencies. Resulting award will be rewarded according to complexity approximation of resulting software.
**CREDITS** Each and every submission will be considered thoroughly. If a good solution is provided but isn’t elected for a prize, the protocol may still provide credits in $ZKP form for the work.

## Rewards per Complexity

**LOW** $ZKP worth $500, 4 instances identified
**MEDIUM** $ZKP worth $1,000, 5 instances identified
**HIGH** $ZKP worth $1,500, 1 instance identified
**BONUS** $ZKP worth 5,000 prize pool available, to be distributed according to work submitted, 1 instance identified
**CREDITS** $ZKP worth $250 for unsuccessful but impressive submissions

## Developer Profile

_SDK_
Developers with experience in back end, Node.js, and/or Typescript are suitable for optimization of the SDK scripts.

_UI_
Developers with React/Next.js and Web/Graphic Design experience are suitable for optimization of the UI elements.

_Containerization_
Further, those with Docker experience will find routes in ensuring cross compatibility for Oshiya in all runtime environments.

_Other_
It is worth noting that any exposure to blockchain/distributed ledger technology and/or zero-knowledge cryptography would stand as an advantage in completing this challenge to a high standard.

Protocol/Team Proposals
The following proposals have been provided by key members of the protocol. The areas in which Oshiya may be optimised is not restricted to these areas alone: further/innovative optimisations are still viable for a BONUS reward.

Enhancements make be implemented in 3 main functional areas:
Core SDK, which provides utility to the zMiner
UI, which currently provides a browser-based interface to operate Oshiya
Overall Improvements, i.e. the non-niche elements of Oshiya including the architecture

While these are natural segregations of the Oshiya service, optimizations to each of these 3 areas may not be mutually exclusive: i.e. where one issue manifests in a multitude of forms, making the segmentation of functional areas somewhat arbitary. Therefore, alternative segregations and cross-feature optimizations are welcomed.
