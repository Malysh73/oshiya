# WASM Files

This directory contains WebAssembly (WASM) files, JavaScript files and keys
which have been generated using the [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom)
and [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) libraries.

## Circom

Circom is a compiler that can take a high-level function description and create
a zkSnark circuit. Circom makes it easy to create complex zkSnark circuits by
abstracting away many of the details of how zkSnarks operate.

For more details, visit the [Circom GitHub repository](https://github.com/iden3/circom).

## SnarkJS

SnarkJS is a pure JavaScript zkSnark library. It provides a number of tools to
perform zkSnark operations, such as creating a Trusted Setup, generating proofs,
verifying proofs, etc.

For more details, visit the [SnarkJS GitHub repository](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs).

## Generation of WASM files

The WASM files in this directory were generated by using these two tools. The
exact methods and functions used depend on the specifics of the project. Please
refer to the official documentation and the project files to understand how
these files were generated.
