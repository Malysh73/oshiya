# Oshiya

This repository contains the code for the Oshiya component, previously known as
the "Panther Miner".

The Oshiya's task is, in exchange for rewards, to append commitments to Unspent
Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to a Merkle Tree of UTXOs maintained on a blockchain
by a specialized Smart Contract called the "BusTree".

Oshiya appends UTXOs in batches, of up to 64 UTXOs at once, providing a SNARK-proof
that justifies validity of the batch and correctness of the batch insertion.

This efficient process of building the Merkle Tree enhances the performance of
the Panther Protocol.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into two main workspaces: SDK and web-client.

1. **SDK Workspace**: This workspace houses the miner's core code. For running
   the miner without a UI, you can use a terminal and Docker. Detailed
   instructions are available in the [SDK Readme](./sdk/README.md) file.

2. **Web-client Workspace**: This workspace contains the code for running the
   miner in a browser. It includes a basic React-based UI and a web worker
   running in the background, which becomes operational once the user inputs the
   necessary configuration data. For deploying your version of the UI, refer to
   the instructions provided in the [web-client Readme](./sdk/README.md) file.

## Configuration

Both versions of Panther Miner require certain configuration settings, which can
be defined in a `.env` file or through the web interface. Here are the necessary
configuration parameters:

-   `RPC_URL`: The URL of the RPC node.
-   `SUBGRAPH_ID`: The ID of the subgraph.
-   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the BusTree Smart Contract.
-   `GENESIS_BLOCK_NUMBER`: block number when the BusTree Smart Contract was deployed.
-   `INTERVAL`: The time (in seconds) between each successive execution.
-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the wallet that will submit the proofs as a Miner.
